# suggestions for cite evaluation

Split corpusIds into 100 bins; see <a href="https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=1ef9019c-eac0-11ed-9ba9-c9bb788c490e&origin_path=%2F~%2Fsemantic_scholar%2Fj.ortega%2Fgraphs%2F">here</a> for an example.  There are almost 100 files there with 3-digit names.
<p>
The first 50 bins are for training.  You can do whatever you want with those ids, and any of their properties.
<p>
The next 50 bins are for testing.  The task is to input an id, and output 10 candidate citations.
