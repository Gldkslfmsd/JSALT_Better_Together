# Scripts for Semantic Scholar API

Some examples of usage

```sh
echo 232040593 | src/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --fields title,externalIds
# {'paperId': '6d9727f1f058614cada3fe296eeebd8ec4fc512a', '
#              externalIds': {'DBLP': 'conf/fat/BenderGMS21', 'DOI': '10.1145/3442188.3445922', 'CorpusId': 232040593},
#              'title': 'On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ'}}`
```

Some useful fields:
<ol>
<li>title</li>
<li>abstract</li>
<li>authors</li>
<li>externalIds (Semantic Scholar receives data from 7 sources: MAG (182M papers), DOI (114M papers), PubMed (35M), DBLP (6M), PubMedCentral (5M), ArXiv (2M), ACL (80k) </li>
<li>citationCount</li>
<li>referenceCount</li>
<li>citations (list of (up to 1000) papers)</li>
<li>references (list of (up to 1000) papers)</li>
<li>embedding (Specter 1 encoding of titles and abstracts)</li>
<li>venue</li>
<li>fieldsOfStudy</li>
<li>s2fieldsOfStudy</li>
<li>openAccessPdf (URL to pdf versions of paper)</li>
<li>tldr (too long; didn't read -- summaries, often based on abstracts</li>
</ol>


```sh
echo '232040593	On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?' | 
src/text_to_embedding.py -o /tmp/foobar
```

This will read lines (tab delimited) with a corpusId in column 1 and text in column 2;
output goes to /tmp/foobar.kwc.i and /tmp/foobar.kwc.f.
The first file is a sequence of int32 (one for each input line);
The second file is a sequence float32 (one record of K=768 for each input line).
You can process these binary files in C or with numpy.fromfile.
There is an optional --model argument which allows you to specify models from HuggingFace.

<p>

The following will output up to 1000 lines, one for each reference.
It will also output up to 1000 lines, one for each citation.  The
first line is a summary with the count of references and citations
(which may exceed 1000).  Subsequent lines start with either
"reference" or "citation".  The next two ids are the corpusId for the
query and the reference/citation.  The last two columns are the number
of citations and the title of the paper.
