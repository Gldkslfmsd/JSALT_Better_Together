<h2>Paper Id to Properties</h2>

See <a href="https://github.com/kwchurch/JSALT_Better_Together/blob/main/doc/semantic_scholar_API.md">instructions for using Semantic Scholar API</a>.

Write a function that uses this API to input a list of paper ids and outputs a json object each id with:
<ol>
<li>title</li>
<li>abstract</li>
<li>ExternalIds</li>
<li>embedding</li>
<li>references</li>
<li>citations</li>
</ol>

Run your function on the ``DeepWalk'' paper.

<h2>Text to Vectors</h2>
See <a href="https://github.com/kwchurch/JSALT_Better_Together/blob/main/doc/HuggingFace_embeddings.md">instructions for using models on HuggingFace to convert text to vectors</a>.

write a function that inputs ids and a model on HuggingFace and outputs embeddings.  The function should get the title and abstract and use that as input to the HuggingFace model.

Run the model on the ``DeepWalk'' paper and each of the papers that that paper references.
